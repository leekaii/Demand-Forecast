# Demand Forecasting Application
This project focuses on building a demand forecasting application designed to predict future sales. The app is built using Streamlit for the user interface and utilizes the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm for time series forecasting. The model was validated and successfully implemented using a real-world sales dataset from Kaggle.

Features
1) Sales Forecasting: Predict future sales trends based on historical data using the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing algorithm.
2) Interactive User Interface: Built with Streamlit, the app provides a clean and intuitive interface, allowing users to upload datasets and visualize forecast results.
3) Customizable Forecasting: Users can adjust model parameters like seasonality and trend smoothing to get more accurate forecasts.
4) Data Visualization: Graphical representation of historical sales data alongside predicted future sales for easy analysis.

Key Technologies
- Python: Primary programming language for model development.
- Streamlit: Framework for building an interactive and user-friendly web application.
- Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing: Time series forecasting algorithm that accounts for trends and seasonality in data.
- Kaggle Dataset: A publicly available dataset used to train and validate the model.
